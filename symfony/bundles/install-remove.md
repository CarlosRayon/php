# Install/Remove Bundles

## Install

```bash
composer require <bundle>
```

## Remove

```bash
composer remove <bundle>
```

Before removing the bundle it is a good practice to see if you have a **recipe** and what this torque makes if you remove the bundle eliminates the **recipe** data:

`composer recipes <bundle>`
